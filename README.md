# MyPortfolio
My professional portfolio, for viewing by current and potential employers and co-workers

## Welcome!
Greetings!  My name is Alvin Revilas.  I have created this GitHub repository to store programming source code and other documents, pictures, videos, and other files, to be viewed by current and potential employers and co-workers, to allow a better view of my skill sets and capabilities.  

## Sections
I am currently (as of 16 Sep 2019) in UCSD's College of Extended Studies Programming Bootcamp.  We are learning current web technologies and computer languages for web pages.  For my portfolio, I will also add other technologies I've studied before, in addition to topics covered by UCSD's Bootcamp.  

So, possible sections can be added as I gain proficiencies.  

### Web Pages with HTML & CSS 
First set of topics from UCSD's Bootcamp

### JavaScript
Second set of topics from UCSD's Bootcamp

### MySQL 
Third set of topics from UCSD's Bootcamp

### React 
Fourth set of topics from UCSD's Bootcamp

### React.js
Fifth set of topics from UCSD's Bootcamp

### PHP 
Some MySQL related projects may have PHP elements to make them work.  

### Unity 
I will be preparing introductory classes of Unity, that will be presented at the 2020 San Diego Comic Fest in March.  I may place relevant notes and files here.
